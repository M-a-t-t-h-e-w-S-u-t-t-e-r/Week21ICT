                Allesandro Giuseppe was a man who wanted to dwelve into italian cuisine. Thus, he made this restaurant, but he felt that it was not enough, that there was still something missing. He tried many things, exprimenting with new italian recipes, or expanding the cuisine he could offer to his customers. But it never solved his problem, it was starting to even affect the staff and how he treated the people around him. Sooner or later he was very distant. Until one day, he thought "What if I were to try travelling around the world?" yes maybe that was the answer, for he did not have any foreign knowlege. And so he decided to travel around by ship for months and months. Never giving up, even though he wasn't the patient type, he knew this was what he needed to do. And so, Months and Months later, all of a sudden he's back to normal, his employee's, questioning themselves in confusion. Until he called for an urgent meeting, and explained what he had discovered. Sooner or later things started to change around the restaurant. And eventually people started to spread talk about Alessandro and started Coming over to eat at his restaurant. Eventually, after years of many failures, complications and stick ups. He not only was a better man than before(He was still he the impatient type.) But that was one of his very qualities that made himm who he was today. And that is how all if itstarted until now.

What I mean to say is one's culture can reflect on one's behavior, way of life or lifestyle, taste, as well as what he sees in life and what he sees in people.in short, to be open minded is to be open to new things as well as new decisions in life.

It has become a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is used as a dip for fresh vegetables in the autumn season.
It is a hearty dish, and, for this reason, it is considered a main course but can also be served as an appetizer. More than food, it is a ritual, a convivial moment of sharing among the diners, who all eat from a single terracotta container.</p>

It is a soup based on a mixture of vegetables, different from region to region, sometimes accompanied by rice or pasta. A noble and nutritious meal, even if the very word “minestrone” has become synonymous, in a negative way, with great mixing and enormous confusion.</p>
